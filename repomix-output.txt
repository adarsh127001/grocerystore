<main instructions>
WHEN GIVING CODE ALWAYS GIVE IN MARKDOWN AND BEFORE THE MARKDOWN EXPLICITLY TELL THE FILE PATH WHERE THE FILE SHOULD RESIDE FOR ANY FILE
ABSOLUTELY NO COMMENTS IN THE CODE
Only Angular Material Allowed for use.
Only go step by step .Ask appropriate questions when necessary.
We need to use reactive forms only and make the forms component reusable such that we can use it at all parts of the application.
Ensure all chart components are reusable with customizable parameters.
Wherever 
We have a huge JSON file with all the data , we shall separate it and create multiple  smaller json files according to requirements and add those in the asset file.
No hardcoding of data.
Yes we shall periodically update the routes file and other required components to ensure functionality
In the account sign up all we need to validate is whether the password and confirm password are the same and these credentials of username and password will get pushed to a separate json file without any encryption.
While logging in the only validation that will be used is whether the username and password matches with the json file  , if user doesn't exist say that or if password is wrong output that.
Always make sure to maintain the appropriate and clean folder structure using concepts like services components and pipes appropriately for simple code.
While logging in we have only one persona that is the manager
In the json if the UTC format is given we need to convert it to normal date dd-mm-yy
In the shipment component first and last column sticky.
We can use highcharts angular wrapper from npm for making a 
When we go to all blog posts we if content is overflowing we must use ellipsis for denoting overflow
When we go inside the specific posts it should have change of image in every 3 seconds for main photo placeholder above the title
We shall implement the maps part at last so leave it for now
Also override the my daily tasks instead of filter just use sort by same as the analysis component 
Refer to the db.json file for ideas

# Grocerystore

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Additional Resources
